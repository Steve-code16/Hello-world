# Hello-world
My first repository

I am a continous learner. Learning for me equates to exploring new ideas and growing as an individual. I just cannot imagine my life devoid of designing and art. I freely axpress my creativity and imagination by designing. And to give my passion of designing and art a platform i have an Instagram account called, @steve_art16.
